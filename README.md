# Personal Drone Blog
This is a personal drone blog created using React, Firebase, Google Maps API and YouTube API. It features an upload button and a login button, as well as a latest video section (from Yt API), profile section, and drone specification module. Please note that the login button is currently only for the admin (you can login with provided credentials) so they can upload new content.

# Features

## Upload Button
The upload button allows the admin to upload new content, such as blog photos, or videos. The content is stored on Firebase and can be accessed through the blog.

## Login Button
The login button is currently only for the admin, who can use it to access the upload button and add new content to the site. Other users can view the content without logging in.

## Latest Video Section
The latest video section displays the most recent video that has been uploaded to the site. Users can watch the video directly on the site or click through to the YouTube page to view it there. 

## How to Run
To run the project, clone the repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then run npm start to start the development server.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this is my first React project, which I created from scratch using Firebase, Google Maps API and YouTube API. The project features an upload button and a login button, as well as a latest video section, profile section, and drone specification module. I learned a lot during the development process and hope to continue improving and adding new features in future versions. Future versions may include additional features, such as comment and like sections, new user registration and more.
